# LeetCode Problems.

## Description:

This will be a well organized repo containing all of my leetcode problems. Each problem will have it's difficulty rating along with a README.md explaining my solution and approach. If you would like to use a piece of my solution feel free and if I use any outside sources for help they will be linked at the top of the README files.

## What I hope to gain:

-> Practice problem solving skills and improving practical approaches.

-> Familiarize myself with patterns used to solve said problems.

-> Increase my experience with Algorithms both beginner and advanced.

-> Be able to teach and explain the problem in prep for tech interviews.

-> Improve my programming skills overall.
